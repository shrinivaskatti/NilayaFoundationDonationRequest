<p>Dear All,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Namaskara! Hearty Wishes from Nilaya Foundation to you and your family during this auspicious Navaratri time and may Goddess Durga bless all of us.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks to all your support and generosity because of which every year Nilaya Foundation is able to award Scholarships to meritorious and economically bright students.</p>

<p>Summary of <strong>proposed scholarship for current academic year(2021-22) is as below.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Every year more &amp; more applications are received for scholarships with increased numbers of deserving applications.<strong> This year a major portion of applicants are impacted by COVID 19 pandemic &amp; related hardships.</strong></p>

<p>Considering the delays in academic sessions/ admissions this year due to COVID, Nilaya Foundation is working &nbsp;for the Scholarship program in two phases.</p>

<p><strong>Phase1 :</strong> (Applications in this phase have been received by <strong>15 Sept 2021</strong>)<br />
700+ applications were received from scholarship aspirants. Evaluated these and identified 198 eligible, needy and deserving students for award of Niaya Foundation Scholarships. Total scholarship to be awarded in <strong>Phase 1 is ~23 Lakhs.</strong><br/></p>

<p>Please <a style="text-color:white" href="http://nilayafoundation.org/Scholorships_Special-d429b509-4aec-46c5-aaf6-ecd9bdafdf31.html">click here for a list of students</a> considered under this scheme. Like last year, we have identified <strong>~15 very special students</strong> who need complete sponsorship of their education.</p>

<p>In order to ensure really deserving candidates are identified, we are doing <strong>further background verification through personal visits to ~82 students</strong> in the next 2-3 weeks. &nbsp;We will keep you updated if any changes in the shortlisted student list or amount.&nbsp;<br />
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Phase2 :</strong>(Applications in this phase will be commencing from 1st week of Nov 2021)<br />
In this phase we will call for applications from students <strong>who got admission after Sept 15</strong>, We will review all these applications and add them to the list in Nov last week. We expect to add another <strong>30-40 students (~7L scholarship).</strong><br/>
<br />
<br />
Sustained support and generous donations year on year from you have made us take another step ahead this year. We felt the need to revise and increase the number of students and with the help of donors like you, we are sure of making this happen. We once again Request to join hands to help needy &amp; bright students for his/her bright future and extend support to students in need.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additional notes :<br />
If you wish to choose the same students whom you sponsored last year then please let us know, we can send you the names whom you helped last year.<br />
Please be judicious while forwarding this mail to others and make sure it is sent to your known person only.</p><br />
